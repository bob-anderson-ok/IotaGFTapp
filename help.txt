General

    The IOTA Flash Timer is based on an Arduino Mega2560 R3 with a custom shield.

    The shield contains a GPS receiver (with a PPS output) and includes a wide dynamic
    range LED intensity control to enable the LED flash intensity to be matched to
    camera and telescope configuration while avoiding pixel saturation during flashes.

    Once stable communication with the Arduino has been established and the appropriate
    NMEA sentences are being received, your Latitude, Longitude, and Altitude will
    be continuously updated and displayed.

    Once "time synch" has been achieved, the UTC data/time will also be continuously
    updated

Central panel

    The large central panel is used to display the output from the Arduino, once it has
    finished resetting and a valid com port has been selected. This display is always
    active but, to avoid excessive memory usage if the app is allowed to run unattended,
    it will be automatically cleared when 100,000 lines are in the list.

baudrate: (entry box)

    When the app starts, the serial port baudrate is set to 250000 baud to match the
    default setting of the Arduino. You will need to change this value only if a
    different baudrate is programmed into the Arduino

Com ports available
(drop down selection list)

    This drop down list shows all the available com ports. Normally, there will
    only be a single com port available, in which case it will be assumed that it
    is the one connected to the Arduino, and it will automatically be selected as
    the "Com port". If there are more than one available com ports, you must
    select the one for the app to use and serial communication with the Arduino
    will not be established until a selection has been made.

    Note: if you make a selection while a com port is currently open, the currently
    open com port is closed.

Port in use: none (label)

    When a com port has been selected, this label will change to give the name
    of the port in use.

Clear output (button)

    Click this button to clear the central panel

(check box) Auto-scroll enabled

    When this box is checked, the display of serial input lines automatically shows
    (scrolls to) the bottom when the next line is received.

Enter cmd: (entry box)  Send (button)

    Enter commands to be sent to the Flash Timer in the entry box.

    Click the Send button to send the contents of the entry box to the
    Arduino. The proper line termination characters are automatically added,
    so there is no need to add them yourself (and would be an error).

Available Arduino commands:

    [] means optional

    flash commands
            flash now
            flash duration [X]          - get/set the current PPS flash duration (seconds)
            flash level    [X]          - get/set the current flash intensity level [ 0 to 255]

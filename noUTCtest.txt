NOTE:

Wait for GPS time to be established.  ("Status: TimeValid PPS" will appear in green at upper left of GUI)

The GPS chip can take a while to acquire enough satellite to begin emitting GPS time.



SPECIAL TEST PROTOCOL AVAILABLE:

If you leave the UTC event data/time entry field empty, and provide a recording duration, and then press:

                    Arm UTC start

a test recording will be preformed after a 10 second delay.

This is provided as a simple way to confirm that your setup will record the observation properly.

The recording length must be a valid non-zero positive time in seconds.

We use that value to calculate a start time for the recording
such that the "event" will occur at the center of the recording.

The program will automatically calculate a starting time that will allow for at least
10 readings before the start of the flash, plus the time for the flash itself,
plus half of the specified recording duration.

This results in the "event UTC time" being positioned at the center of the recording.

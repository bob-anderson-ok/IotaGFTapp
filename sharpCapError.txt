SharpCap is not running on this machine.

Expected work order:

1) Open the SharpCap application and set (if necessary) the TELESCOP and OBSERVER fields (File|SharpCap settings|Saving).

2) Wait for IotaGFT Status to report TimeValid PPS (the GPS chip sometimes need extended time begin emitting GPS time)

3) Select a camera in SharpCap.

4) Any other SharpCap tools and scripts can be run at any convenient time like "plate solve", "goto", etc.

5) Select an exposure time and gain that is appropriate for the observation.

6) Activate the histogram tool in SharpCap.

7) With the LED off, set the black level so that there is no background clipping visible in the histogram.

8) Turn the LED on (the check box at lower right) and use the LED intensity slider to set an intensity that causes
      the histogram to register a small increase in overall pixel intensities. This value is "sticky" between sessions.

9) Set UTC event time (time at center of event) and recording duration and click the Arm UTC start button OR
      leave this field empty, in which case the event time is assumed to be 10 seconds in the future.
      This gives a simple way to run a test recording to make sure that the observation parameters
      are set properly.


NOTE: If you make any changes to the camera exposure time, BE SURE TO click the Arm UTC start button
           again so that the change can be incorporated in the start time and flash duration.

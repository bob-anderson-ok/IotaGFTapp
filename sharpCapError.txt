SharpCap is not running on this machine.

Expected work order:

1) Open the SharpCap application.

2) Select a camera.

3) Select an exposure time and gain that is appropriate for the observation.

4) Activate the histogram tool in SharpCap.

5) With the LED off, set the black level so that there is no background clipping visible in the histogram.

6) Turn the LED on (the check box at lower right) and use the LED intensity slider to set an intensity that causes
      the histogram to register a small increase in overall pixel intensities.

7) Set UTC event time (time at center of event) and recording duration and click the Arm UTC start button.

8) Any other SharpCap tools and scripts can be run at any convenient time.

NOTE: If you make any changes to the camera exposure time, BE SURE TO click the Arm UTC start button
           again so that the change can be incorporated in the start time and flash duration.
